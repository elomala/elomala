<h1>Introduction</h1>
Hello, I'm elomala. I am a Roblox game developer and I've made multiple games. I have 2+ years of experience in luaU coding for game development.<br>
I specialize in scripting but I can also make simple GUIs and models. 
Currently, I have only used Roblox Studio, but I plan on using Unity and making more games over there.
Make sure to check out my games on Roblox. I also work duo with another developer in <a href="https://www.roblox.com/groups/33097135/Tesseract-Productions#!/about">Tesseract Productions</a>.<br>
<h1>Current Project</h1>
I'm currently working on a Roblox hide-and-seek type game called <a href="https://www.roblox.com/games/14773789732/Lurk">Lurk</a> with a fellow developer. The game looks amazing and has some epic powerups and twists! I am in charge of the scripting and functionalities while the other developer makes maps.
